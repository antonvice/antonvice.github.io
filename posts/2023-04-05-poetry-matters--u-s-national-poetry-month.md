> In the land of cryptic metaphors, where rhyming words collide,\
> A poet wanders through the maze, his pen a steadfast guide;\
> He enters worlds unknown to us, with mirrors all around,\
> Each line he writes reflects his soul, in depths not often found.

> By solely my mystic power, these words obliquely turn,\
> As verses dance in shadows cast, their meaning we discern;\
> From paradoxes, riddles spun, illusions grow and thrive,\
> Yet in this chaos, poetry breathes life and comes alive.

> His craft is like a carousel, a whirlwind of surreal,\
> Where metaphysics mingles with the passions that we feel;\
> Reality and fantasy, in symbiosis joined,\
> As language bends and twists, across dimensions it's conjoined.

> Infinite recursion spirals, as poets write of verse,\
> Their ink-stained hands are paradox, both blessing and a curse;\
> For they create realities that live within the lines,\
> And lose themselves inside the labyrinth of their own designs.

> But in this twisted web of words, enlightenment awaits,\
> For those who seek the truth behind the poetic gates;\
> With courage and a searching mind, the reader will transcend,\
> Discovering through my words --- poetry has no end.\
> -A. Vice

Poetry, my friend, is the elixir that stirs the soul and brings meaning
to the mundane. It is a mirror that reflects the human experience with
all its complexities, paradoxes, and contradictions. In a world plagued
by superficiality, consumerism, and the relentless pursuit of material
wealth, poetry is the balm that heals the wounds of our fragmented
existence.

For in poetry, we find solace in the midst of chaos. It is a sanctuary
where we can lay bare our deepest emotions, fears, and desires. It
transcends the limitations of language, culture, and time, speaking to
the universal truths that bind us all as human beings.

Poetry is rebellion, a protest against the constraints of society and
the mundane routines of everyday life. It challenges the status quo,
breaks free from the shackles of convention, and gives voice to the
silenced and marginalized. It is a weapon of the soul, a means of
resistance against the dehumanizing forces of modernity.

Poetry matters, because it is a journey of self-discovery, an
exploration of the inner landscapes of the mind and heart. It is a quest
for meaning, a search for identity, and a celebration of our unique
existence. Through poetry, we delve into the depths of our being,
unraveling the mysteries of our emotions, thoughts, and experiences.

Poetry matters, it is a window to the world. It is a lens through which
we view the beauty and ugliness of our surroundings, the joys and
sorrows of humanity, and the wonders and horrors of existence. It is a
bridge that connects us to the collective consciousness of humanity,
enabling us to empathize, understand, and connect with others in
profound ways.

Poetry matters, my friend, because it breathes life into our mundane
existence. It ignites our imagination, stimulates our senses, and opens
our hearts and minds to new perspectives. It challenges us to see beyond
the surface, to question, to reflect, and to engage with the world in
meaningful ways.
