## Intro: 

Preparing for a Python coding interview is an important part of the
process to get the job you want. Because Python is one of the most
popular programming languages, employers are increasingly turning to it
as a way of testing applicants' coding skills.

Knowing what to expect, and how to prepare, can help ensure that you
make the best possible impression during your interview.

When it comes to preparing for a Python coding interview, there are
three main areas you should focus on:

1.  [knowledge of libraries and tools]
2.  [General problem-solving strategies]
3.  [Understanding algorithms and data structures.]

Here's what you should know about each area before heading into your
next coding interview:

**Knowledge Of Libraries And Tools:**

You will be expected to have strong familiarity with common library
functions in Python. Make sure you review examples of how these
libraries can be used in actual code so that you're prepared with
questions related to their use in an application or project.
Additionally, knowing some modern tools such as Jupyter Notebook or
Scikit-learn can help demonstrate both your efficiency skills and
fluency in the language.

**General Problem-Solving Strategies:**

During a coding interview, employers may ask questions about specific
problems related to sorting algorithms or graph traversal methods. Being
able to answer these requires strong knowledge of basic problem-solving
principles like time complexity and space complexity analysis --- which
involves understanding Big O notation --- as well as being familiar with
debugging techniques and different approaches for solving problems from
scratch instead of relying on libraries.

**Understanding Algorithms And Data Structures:**

While knowledge of algorithms and data structures is not essential for
coding in Python, it becomes very important in a technical interview.
You should be familiar with the core data types --- like strings,
tuples, lists, and dictionaries --- as well as understand how different
search algorithms like a linear search and binary search work.
Additionally, you'll need to have an understanding of basic sorting
algorithms such as bubble sort and merge sort.

Another important factor in the interview process is knowing what kind
of questions to expect. Most code interviews will focus on
problem-solving and algorithm design. Be prepared to answer questions
related to these topics as well as questions about your experience with
Python specifically. It's also important that you be able to explain why
certain solutions would work better than others for certain problems or
tasks.

## Example Questions: 

-   [**Write a concise function to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers
    in python:**]

``` 
def generateFibonacci(n):
  result = [] a, b = 0, 1
  while a < n:
    result.append(a)
    a, b = b, a + b
  return result

print(generateFibonacci(1000))
```

-   [**Write a class to represent an integer and a function to return
    whether or not is a palindrome in python:**]

``` 
## Class for an Integer
class Integer:
## Constructor
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
## Function to check if an Integer is a palindrome
  def isPalindrome(self):
    num = self.value
## Reverse the number
    rev = 0
    while num > 0:
      rev = (rev * 10) + (num % 10)
      num = num // 10
## Check if the reversed number is equal to the original number
    if rev == self.value:
      return True
    else:
      return False
## Create an instance of the Integer class
number = Integer(121)
## Check if the number is a palindrome
if number.isPalindrome():
  print("The number is a Palindrome")
else:
  print("The number is not a Palindrome")
```

Dict and list comprehensions are methods of creating dictionaries and
lists using a more concise syntax.

-   [**What does pass mean in Python?**]

Pass in Python is a keyword that is used as a placeholder when a
statement is required syntactically, but there is no actual code to
execute.

-   [**What is a negative index?**]

A negative index is an index that counts from the end of a sequence
instead of the beginning. It can be used to access elements from the end
of a sequence.

-   [**What do you consider to be the top three benefits of using
    Python?**]

1.  [Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and straightforward
    syntax which makes it an ideal language for beginners. It also has a
    large library of existing code, making it easy for developers to
    find solutions for their projects.]
2.  [Flexibility: Python is versatile and can be used for web
    development, data science, scripting, game development, and
    more.]
3.  [Efficiency: Python is designed to make coding easier and faster,
    allowing developers to write code more quickly and
    efficiently.]

-   [**Is Python an interpreted or uninterpreted language?**]

What does that mean? Python is an interpreted language. This means that
it is read and run by an interpreter, which translates the code
line-by-line into machine code that can be executed by the computer.
This is in contrast to compiled languages, which are translated into
machine code all at once before they can be executed.

-   [**How does Python manage memory?**]

Python manages memory using its own private heap space. All objects and
data structures are stored in a private heap. The memory manager is
responsible for allocating and freeing memory for Python objects. The
core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code. Python
also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused
memory and makes it available for the heap space.

-   [**What is the difference between a list and a tuple?**]

A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of different types
and can be modified (items can be added, removed, or changed), while a
tuple is an ordered collection of items that can be of different types
but cannot be modified (items cannot be added, removed, changed).

-   [**How is Python executed?**]

Python is usually executed by running the python interpreter on the
command line. The interpreter reads and executes the Python code in the
file. It can also be executed from within an integrated development
environment (IDE), such as IDLE, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code. Python
code can also be executed in a web browser using tools such as Brython
and Skulpt.

-   [**How is code checking done in Python?**]

Code checking in Python is typically done through a tool called a
linter. A linter is a program that scans through code and looks for
potential errors, such as syntax errors, formatting issues, or
potentially dangerous code. The linter then provides feedback to the
programmer about what errors were found and how to fix them.

-   [**How are instance variables different from class
    variables?**]

Instance variables are variables that belong to a specific instance (or
object) of a class, while class variables are variables that belong to
the entire class. Instance variables are typically used to store
information that is specific to a particular object, and their values
are distinct from one instance of a class to the next. Class variables,
on the other hand, are typically used to store information that applies
to the entire class, such as a constant or a default value, and their
values are the same across all instances of a class.

-   [**Is Python case sensitive?**]

Yes, Python is case sensitive.

-   [**Is indentation in python required?**]

Yes, an indentation in Python is required in order to indicate separate
blocks of code. Indentation helps make code easier to read and also
provides logical structure.

-   [**How do you generate random numbers in Python?**]

You can generate random numbers in Python using the random module. The
random module has a variety of functions to generate random numbers.

One example is the randint() function, which takes two integer arguments
and returns a random integer between them.

For example:

``` 
import random
random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number) ## Prints a random number between 1 and 10
```

-   [**How do you copy an object in Python?**]

To copy an object in Python, you can use the built-in function
copy.copy() or copy.deepcopy(). The copy.copy() function will make a
shallow copy of the object

-   [**How can you convert a number to a string in python?**]

You can convert a number to a string in Python by using the str()
function. For example:

``` 
num = 1
str_num = str(num)
print(str_num) ## Output: '1'
```

-   [**How can you make a Python script executable on Unix?**]

To make a Python script executable on Unix, you can use the chmod
command. First, open the terminal and navigate to the directory
containing the script. Then, type "chmod +x \<scriptname.py\>" to make
the script executable.

-   [**How do you write comments in Python?**]

Comments in Python are indicated by the hash (#) symbol. Anything
written after the hash symbol is interpreted as a comment and ignored by
Python during execution.

Example:

``` 
## This is a comment in Python
```

-   [**Illustrate the correct method for Python error handling**]

Below is an example of Python error handling:

``` 
try: ## Code to be executed
  pass
except Exception as e: ## Code to be executed if an exception is raised print("An error has occurred: " + str(e))
  finally: ## Code to be executed regardless of exception
    print("Error handling complete")
```

-   [**When would you use a continue statement in a loop?**]

You would use a continue statement in a loop when you want to skip the
current iteration and continue with the next one.

-   [**When would you use a break statement?**]

You would use a break statement when you want to exit the loop
immediately.

-   [**Demonstrate how to delete a file in Python. The following command
    will delete a file named \`my_file.txt\`:**]

```` 
```
import os
os.remove("my_file.txt")
```
````

-   [**How would you access a module written in Python from C?**]

You would need to use a Python/C API such as CPython to access a module
written in Python from C. The CPython API provides functions and macros
to directly invoke Python objects and functions from C.

-   [**How would you convert a string to all lowercase in
    python?**]

Use the str.lower() method:

``` 
string_example = "HELLO WORLD!"
string_example.lower() ## Output: "hello world!"
```

-   [**Show what len() does in python:**]

The len() function returns the length (the number of items) of an
object. It can be used on sequences such as strings, lists, and tuples,
as well as collections such as dictionaries.

-   [**How would you import modules in Python?**]

``` 
import pandas as pd
```
